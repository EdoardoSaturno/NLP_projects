Now a common health card for the EU, especially for insurance purposes and very important medical info (implants, transplants, severe allergies, blood type) yes. This makes sense, it does not infringe on privacy and everyone will agree to such a card. The moment you want a diagnosis and other stuff, that's where you are way off.

It is an illusion that the smuggling of such drugs can be controlled. Billions of euros have been spent trying to combat smuggling but have not reduced the supply of such drugs. Legalization of the least harmful drugs will allow the quality of the drugs to be controlled (hence reducing harm); reduce exposure to more harmful drugs (because dealers currently introduce users of soft drugs to harder drugs), and cut out a significant source of drug dealer revenues.\n",

It is striking that it occurs most where contact with migration is least common. Of course, any immigration of people from other cultural backgrounds is a challenge. Of course, there must also be rules for immigrants. But the challenge must be accepted.

    "1. Not surprisingly, the CPS model emerges as the top-performing model, due to the richness of information encapsulated in its embeddings. Notably, the inclusion of Stance adds valuable insights into the relationship between Premise and Conclusion, fostering a more comprehensive understanding of the entire sentence from the model's perspective and resulting in a more balanced classification. It is observed that in models that receive simpler inputs there is a tendency towards \"majority classifier\" behavior, where a substantial number of examples are classified into the most frequent classes. Contrarily, models handling more complex inputs, such as CP and CPS, do partially overcome this problem. In case of C we can see that the models are so biased towards the majority classes that they outperform CPS, but when we look ad the less frequent one we can see a drop in performance as high as 0.4.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The most challenging classes appear to be those with lower representation in the dataset, namely \"Openness to Change\" and \"Self-enhancement.\" Even better performing models demonstrate poorer performance for these categories, suggesting a challenge more inherent to the data distribution rather than from limitations of the architectures themselves. Addressing this issue may require the adoption of more complex models or the implementation of strategies such as class balancing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In an initial attempt, we employed the \"distill-BERT\" architecture and observed similar results for CP and CPS. Subsequently, we utilized the \"bert-base-uncased\" architecture and noticed a differentiation in performance among the same set of models. This discrepancy could be attributed to the fact that distill-BERT is a simplified version of BERT, and its maximum performance may be more easily attained by CP.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In examining the performance of each model relative to the majority and random classifiers, the following observations can be made:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - BertC demonstrates superiority over the classifiers in certain classes but falls short on achieving this for all classes. It can be surpassed by the majority classifier in the most frequent classes and by the random classifier in the less represented ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - BertCP exhibits greater resilience, consistently outperforming the classifiers in nearly all cases, with only occasional exceptions when compared to the majority  classifier in the most frequent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A similar pattern of performance is observed for CPS, maintaining comparable effectiveness across various classes."
