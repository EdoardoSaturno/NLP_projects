# POS Tagging with Recurrent Neural Networks

This project addresses **Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging** using **recurrent neural architectures** such as LSTM and GRU-based models.

## Objective

The goal is to build a neural sequence labeling model capable of accurately assigning POS tags to words in a sentence, leveraging the sequential context via recurrent neural networks.

## Dataset

The project uses the [NLTK Dependency Treebank](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nltk/nltk_data/gh-pages/packages/corpora/dependency_treebank.zip), which contains syntactically annotated sentences suitable for POS tagging tasks.
