# Projects
This repository contains projects that were part of my Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence. Please note that I collaborated with other individuals as co-authors for these projects.

## ERC_EFF : EMOTION DISCOVERY AND MOOD FLIP REASONING IN CONVERSATIONS (EDIREF)
- **Description:** A BERT model is employed to classify the emotion associated to the utterances of a series of dialogues taken from the F.R.I.E.N.D.S TV show. Also, the model is able to recognize the particular utterance(s) triggering a change in the mood of the speakers. 
- **Technologies:** Python, PyTorch, Transformers
- **Results:** The results highlight the promising impact of BERT models for emotion classification tasks. Particularly, the non-trivial challenge of recognizing mood flip utterances demonstrates the effectiveness of complex models like BERT in handling this kind of conversational analysis.

## POS_Tagging : NEURAL NETWORKS FOR PART OF SPEECH (POS) TAGGING
- **Descritpion:** Three recurrent neural models based on Bidirectional LSTM layers are employed to perform a Part Of Speech (POS) task.
- **Technologies:** Python, Keras, GloVE.
- **Results:** For detailed results and analysis, please refer to the relative report.

## Human_Values_Detection : MULTI-LABEL TEXT CLASSIFICATION WITH TRANSFORMERS
- **Description:** A transformer-based architecture is employed to perform a text classification. In particular the classification is about the particular human emotion related to the text. A comparison between the transformer-based architecture and more traditional machine learning baselines is provided.
- **Technologies:** Python, PyTorch, Transformers.
- **Results:** For detailed results and analysis, please refer to the relative report.

## PSI_Extraction_Healtcare 4: PAPER SELECTION AND INFORMATION EXTRACTION IN HEALTHCARE DOMAIN
- **Description:** This project compares traditional TF-IDF representations with dense BERT representations in a paper selection and information extraction task within the healthcare domain. The task involves identifying relevant papers for a systematic review on Wilson's disease.
- **Technologies:** Python, PyTorch, Transformers.
- **Results:** Results highlight the superiority of more recent transformer-based dense representation of documents with respect to old sparse representations.
